    <p> 
      Honored for her services in the army, Deborah Sampson was born on December 17, 1760 with an ambition for adventure which lead her to join the army. In 1782, at age 21, Deborah enlisted in the army as Robert Shurtliff and was able to fool both the captain and general that she was a man. After 17 months of battling Tories her secret was finally discovered when she fell unconscious and needed to be examined. After being discharged honarably for her services, she got married, took care of 4 children, and traveled the world to give speeches about her adventures. Sixty-six year old Deborah Sampson eventually died on April 29, 1827 due to yellow fever but the tales of her adventures as a soldier were never forgotten.

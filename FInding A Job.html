<body align="center">
    <p> When Deborah finally became 18, she was able to leave the Thomas family and their house to find a job. Back then, woman could not learn to trade like many men did, so instead, Deborah went back to middleborough to help the Thomas family once more throughout the year until summer came around. During the summer's of a couple years, Deborah taught as a teacher for children who loved her. They were taught everything Deborah knew. Before the next summer, Deborah decided to visit her mother who told her to settle down and get married, but Deborah sought for adventure. That's when 21 year old Deborah decided she wanted to join the army and become a Continental soldier.

    <p> Born on December 17, 1760 in Plympton, Massechusetts, Deborah Sampson had a rough childhood, moving from house to house serving its' owners. When Deborah was very young, her father left the family leaving only her mother to take care of the five children. Too poor and sick, her mother had no choice and was forced to send her beloved children to other families. Deborah the youngest of her 4 other siblings, was only five when she was sent to her aunt's house. Although, Deborah happily enjoyed learning the alphabet and the hours and hours of reading lessons. When her aunt died from an illness, Deborah was sent to help and live with Mrs. Thatcher, who was an 80 year old woman in need of someone who could cook, clean, and carry the firewoood for her. After Mrs. Thatcher died, Deborah moved to the final house she would live in until she was 18. The Thomas family's house. There, she was treated poorly and forced to become a servant for the Thomas family. Deborah was rarely ever allowed to go out and she would have to live like this for the next ten years of her life.

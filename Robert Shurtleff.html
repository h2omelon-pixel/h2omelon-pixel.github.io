	Deborah Sampson enlisted in the army as Robert Shurtliff and was able to pull off the fact that she was a man. Before recieving both her gun and uniform at West Point, she and many other men were forced to walk there all the way from New York, taking her and the men a total of two weeks. There she trained and fought battles against the Tories who were people loyal to King Geoerge III. Thousands of soldiers were shot and of those thousands of soldiers, Deborah was one of them. She was riding her horse, battling Tories until suddenly Deborah felt a sharp pain spread throughout her thigh. Then she felt a warm liquid running down her leg and instantly knew she was shot. Deborah fell off the horse and onto the gorund until a soldier passed by and carried Deborah back to their camp where she would hopefully survive the wound. If the bullet was to be removed, her secret would have been discovered so Deborah decided to remove the bullet herself. Using a pocket knife, she dug it into the flesh of her thigh, fishing for the bullet. Forcing her knife deeper into her wound, Deborah finally found the bullet and carefully plucked it out of her thigh. 

	A couple months later in Philadelphia, a terrible fever started spreading and unfortunately, Deborah caught it. She fainted and was sent to the hospital for an examination. Still unconscious, Deborah's secret was discovered and the Doctor sent the general a letter exposing it. Finally back to a healthy state, Deborah was asked to see the general who was astonished to find that the secret was as a matter of fact true.
